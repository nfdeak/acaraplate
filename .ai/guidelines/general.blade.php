# General Guidelines

- Don't include any superfluous PHP Annotations, except ones that start with `@` for typing variables.

# Laravel Wayfinder Guidelines

When you generate the routes, use `--with-form` so that `Wayfinder` can create form request classes for you, like so;

```shell
php artisan wayfinder:generate --with-form
```

## Approach for writing tests

 - Use a cleaner, more testable approach. Separate edge cases into their own methods or classes.
 - Use data providers to test multiple scenarios in a single test method.

## Test Coverage Workflow

WHAT MAKES A GREAT TEST:
A great test covers behavior users depend on. It tests a feature that, if broken, would frustrate or block users. It validates real workflows, not implementation details, and it catches regressions before users do. Do NOT write tests just to increase coverage—use coverage as a guide to find untested user-facing behavior. If uncovered code is not worth testing (boilerplate, unreachable error branches, internal plumbing), add @codeCoverageIgnoreStart and @codeCoverageIgnoreEnd annotations instead of writing low-value tests.

PROCESS:
1. Run herd coverage ./vendor/bin/pest --coverage --parallel to see which files have low coverage.
2. Read the uncovered lines and identify the most important user-facing feature that lacks tests. Prioritize: error handling users will hit, controller actions, form requests, service methods, Artisan commands, API endpoints. Deprioritize: internal utilities, edge cases users won't encounter, framework boilerplate.
3. Write ONE meaningful Pest test that validates the feature works correctly for users.
4. Run herd coverage ./vendor/bin/pest --coverage --parallel again; coverage should rise as a side effect of testing real behavior.
5. Commit with message: test(<file>): <describe the user behavior being tested>
6. Append super-concise notes to test-coverage-progress.txt describing what you tested, current coverage %, and any learnings.

ONLY WRITE ONE TEST PER ITERATION.
If statement coverage reaches 100%, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>.

## Code Testability Guidelines

- **Avoid inline closures in controller responses** - When returning data from controllers (especially with Inertia), don't use inline closures for data transformation as they are difficult to test.
- **Extract formatting logic to models** - Instead of writing transformation closures in controllers, add dedicated methods to models (e.g., `toResponseData()`, `formattedItemsByCategory()`) that can be unit tested independently.
- **Use DTOs for response data** - Instead of inline array type declarations like `@return array{id: int, name: string}`, create dedicated Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) in `app/Data/` using Spatie Laravel Data.
- **Keep controller methods thin** - Controllers should orchestrate, not transform. Move data formatting and business logic to models, actions, or dedicated service classes.

### Bad Example (untestable closure with inline array type):
```php
// In Controller - hard to test, inline type declaration
/**
 * @return array{id: int, name: string}
 */
return [
    'items' => $collection->map(fn ($item) => [
        'id' => $item->id,
        'name' => $item->name,
    ]),
];
```

### Good Example (testable method with DTO):
```php
// In Data/ItemResponseData.php
final class ItemResponseData extends Data
{
    public function __construct(
        public int $id,
        public string $name,
    ) {}
}

// In Model
public function toResponseData(): ItemResponseData
{
    return new ItemResponseData(
        id: $this->id,
        name: $this->name,
    );
}

// In Controller
return [
    'items' => $collection->map(fn ($item) => $item->toResponseData()),
];
```

## When you want to use local model `scope`, use the Scope Attribute in Laravel 12.

<code-snippet name="Laravel 12 Local Model Scope Example" lang="php">
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Attributes\Scope;
 
#[Scope]
protected function popular(Builder $query): void
{
    $query->where('votes', '>', 100);
}
</code-snippet>
