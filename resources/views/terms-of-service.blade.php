                <p>
                    Welcome to Acara Plate, an open-source platform designed to provide personalized nutrition guidance through
                    AI-driven meal plans and dietary tools, including the Acara Health Sync companion app for iOS. By accessing or using our website, applications, and
                    services (collectively, the “Services”), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (“Terms”).
                </p>

                <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
                <p>
                    By creating an account or using the Services, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, you may
                    not use the Services. Acara Plate may update these Terms at its discretion, and your continued use
                    after changes indicates acceptance of the updated Terms.
                </p>

                <h2>2. Use of Services</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>a. Eligibility:</strong>
                    You must be at least 18 years old to use the Services due to the collection of sensitive health
                    data, in compliance with applicable laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
                    for EU users. You confirm you are of legal age to enter a binding contract.
