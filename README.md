## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This application is built with:

- **PHP 8.4**
- **Composer 2** — PHP dependency manager
- **Node.js 20+**
- **Laravel 12** — backend API and frontend delivery
- **[Laravel AI SDK](https://github.com/laravel/ai-sdk)** — AI agents, tools, and streaming
- **[Workflow](https://github.com/durable-workflow/workflow)** — durable workflow orchestration for meal plan generation
- **React 19** — frontend UI layer
- **Inertia.js** — bridges Laravel and React
- **Tailwind CSS** — utility-first styling
- **PostgreSQL 17+** (pgvector recommended for advanced features)

### Project Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/acara-app/plate.git
cd plate
git checkout -b feat/your-feature # or fix/your-fix
```

Create a feature branch instead of committing directly to `main`, then install and bootstrap dependencies:

```bash
composer setup
```

`composer setup` runs Composer and NPM installs, copies `.env.example`, generates the app key, and executes migrations.

### Environment Configuration

Configure the credentials you need in `.env`. Only the providers you enable in code require keys.

```bash
# Optional AI Provider API Keys (choose any subset)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_key
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key
MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_mistral_key
XAI_API_KEY=your_xai_key
OLLAMA_URL=http://localhost:11434 # if using local Ollama

# Optional OAuth
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
```

### Running the Development Server

```bash
composer run dev
```

Use `npm run build` and your Herd `.test` domain when validating PWA installability. Clear site data if the service worker appears stale.

### Telegram Bot (Optional)

To test Telegram bot integration locally:

1. Install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/): `brew install ngrok`
2. Start tunnel: `ngrok http https://plate.test`
3. Update `.env`:
    ```env
    TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token
    TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_DOMAIN=https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io
    ```
4. Register bot: `php artisan telegraph:new-bot`
5. Set webhook: `php artisan telegraph:set-webhook`

### Testing & Code Quality

Run the full QA suite:

```bash
composer test
```

Targeted commands are also available:

```bash
composer test:unit         # Unit & feature tests (100% coverage enforced)
composer test:type-coverage
composer test:lint         # Pint, Rector, oxlint, Prettier
composer test:types        # PHPStan + TypeScript
composer lint              # Auto-fix styling issues
```

## Data Initialization

### Database Seeding

```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=GoalSeeder
php artisan db:seed --class=LifestyleSeeder
php artisan db:seed --class=DietaryPreferenceSeeder
php artisan db:seed --class=HealthConditionSeeder
```

### USDA Food Database Import

Acara Plate relies on USDA FoodData Central for accurate nutrition data:

1. Download **Foundation Foods** and **SR Legacy Foods** (JSON) from [FoodData Central](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/download-datasets).
2. Place the files in `storage/sources/`.
3. Import using the provided Artisan commands:

```bash
php artisan import:usda-food-foundation-data
php artisan import:usda-sr-legacy-food-data

# Use custom paths if needed
php artisan import:usda-food-foundation-data --path=/path/to/foundation.json
php artisan import:usda-sr-legacy-food-data --path=/path/to/legacy.json
```

**Performance & Indexing**

- Streaming import efficiently handles large JSON payloads.
- Foundation Foods (~1,200 entries) completes in ~2-5 seconds; SR Legacy (>8,000) in ~10-30 seconds.
- Operations run within database transactions and surface progress in real time.
- Full-text indexes on the `description` column accelerate search (created on MySQL/PostgreSQL, skipped on SQLite).

## Deployment

### Self-Hosting Options

- **Laravel Forge:** Automated provisioning for VPS providers (DigitalOcean, Linode, Vultr, AWS).
- **Ploi:** Laravel Forge–style GUI for provisioning, deployments, cron management, and queue supervision.
- **Laravel Cloud:** Fully managed Laravel platform with zero server maintenance.

### Production Environment

The live deployment is hosted on [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/) with [Ploi](https://ploi.io/) coordinating releases. This setup serves as a practical template for similar self-managed installations. The current server runs Ubuntu 22.04 LTS with 2 vCPUs, 2 GB RAM, and 50 GB SSD storage.

- **Database:** Dedicated PostgreSQL VM isolated from the application server
- **Backups:** [pgBackRest](https://pgbackrest.org/) provides automated, incremental backups

### Future Enhancements

- IndexedDB caching for limited offline PWA usage (recipes, recent plans)
- Parallelized queue workers for faster meal plan generation

## Accessing Acara Plate

The application is available as a regular responsive web app—open your configured domain in any modern browser to use it immediately. Installing the PWA is optional and simply delivers an app-like shell around the same experience.

### Progressive Web App

Acara Plate ships as an installable PWA for mobile and desktop:

- **Capabilities:** Home screen install, standalone window, responsive layout
- **Current Limitation:** Offline mode is not yet available; an internet connection is required

**Installation**

- **iOS/iPadOS (Safari):** Share → Add to Home Screen
- **Android (Chrome):** Browser menu → Add to Home screen
- **Desktop (Chrome/Edge):** Click the install icon in the address bar or choose Install from the menu

**Updates**

- A new deployment becomes active after the service worker installs and the app performs a fresh reload
- If an update appears stuck, complete a hard refresh or clear storage for the domain

## Adding New Translations

Acara Plate welcomes translation contributions! The application uses a dual translation system:

**Backend (Laravel):**

- Translation files are located in `lang/{locale}/` (e.g., `lang/fr/`, `lang/es/`)
- Copy an existing locale directory (e.g., `lang/en/`) and translate the PHP array values
- Key files: `common.php`, `auth.php`, `validation.php`, `passwords.php`, `pagination.php`

**Frontend (React):**

- Translations are loaded from Laravel backend via Inertia.js
- React components use `react-i18next` with the `useTranslation()` hook
- No separate frontend translation files needed—all translations come from Laravel

**To add a new language:**

1. Create a new directory in `lang/` with the locale code (e.g., `lang/es/` for Spanish)
2. Copy all PHP files from `lang/en/` to your new locale directory
3. Translate the array values while keeping the keys unchanged
4. Test your translations by switching the app locale

**Usage in React Components:**

```tsx
import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next';

export default function MyComponent() {
    const { t } = useTranslation('common'); // Specify namespace
    return <h1>{t('welcome')}</h1>;
}
```

**Usage in Laravel:**

```php
// In controllers or Blade templates
__('common.welcome');
__('auth.throttle', ['seconds' => 60]); // With parameters
```

**Translation Namespaces:**

- `auth` - Authentication-related strings
- `common` - Common UI elements and general translations
- `validation` - Form validation messages
- `passwords` - Password reset and management
- `pagination` - Pagination controls
